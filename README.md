# textEd
Text editors are important tools that help us to write the code, we tried to create one such text editor which works through the Linux terminal and that enable us to write and edit our texts and code.  The text editor is able to do all the basic functions like write, edit, syntax highlighting, save the file, save the file as, find in the document.

Keys:
CTRL-S: Save
CTRL-Q: Quit
CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)
